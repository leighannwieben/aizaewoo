Im doing my 6-7th rewatch of the Stargate universe, and im up to season 3 of Atlantis now, and i just cant get over how bloody incompetent wier is as a leader.

Kinda hokey but 3 years ago today I made the unplanned and impulse based choice to quit smoking cold turkey. I truly believe that is the way to do it. I say this as ive smoked pretty heavily and quitting was honestly not that bad. Not nearly as dreadful as I've always heard it to be. Maybe the planning, anticipation, weaning, and nicotine alternatives are what make the quitting process so torturous. A side note to this is I've always seen people smelling flowers and I never understood Okay, long story short, our local Sci-Fi convention has a theme of "Monty Python and Mad Max" this year (no, I don't know why they've combined them) and I've been asked by the organizers to come do a talk on "could you survive in the REAL wasteland?" Now, most of these people are pretty sedentary, and the time allotted is only an hour, so I have to make it quick, and mildly entertaining. So, I thought I'd boil it down to one item from the Road Warrior movie; the can of dog food that Max enjoys. So I've been thinking on this for a while and we really didn't get much with payback and it's dlc, and as a person who has movie projects on his mind all the time I was thinking "what could've ea done to payback to continue with the storyline" and as replaying MW 05, it hit me. (Note: this does involve NFS MW 05 and Carbon Because it is in the same universe. Also it's hard to incorporate all characters respectively and putting them into all aspects of the dlc.) The dlc goes like this Rockp. I remember in elementary school, Bakugan just became a thing. I remember my aunt, or maybe my mom, buying me a blue ball, with some wiers cards. They were oddly thick and weighty, and some had a cool dragon on them. “Hey Andy! I saw these at the store and thought of you.” She handed me a cellophane wrapped package. “I know how much you love collecting cards,” She was right, looking on my bookshelf, you could see Pokémon, Yugioh, Beyblade, Magic, and bleach cards. I rarely played these games Disclaimer: sorry if this isn’t specific to EXFOR, I just figured this is a community of folks who have a passion for similar sci fi stories. Hopefully everyone else can benefit from the discussion. Hey guys I’m halfway through Mavericks and I’m a HUGE fan of the series. It’s easily my favorite of all of the series I’ve read so far. I was looking for recommendations of other similar audio book series. I travel quite a bit for work and have a ton of time to listen to series These are some things you may have heard about EOS!

I don't get what in the world is going on. I've been trying to make a med bay forever. I've even moved it three times and they will not build any of it! I'm on cycle 21 and am about to give up. https://i.imgur.com/JPC1DeJ.png The room above was planned and laid out for a while now and the dups will not touch it to finish it. With stress and illness rising, even more, I re-located the tables THREE TIMES and each the dups just walk by and 100% ignore it. My last attempt was placing ( Had a bit of spare time, so I penned out a rough story for my nighthaunt. Basing and converting the army to fit into a folk horror vibe, lots of influence from dark folklore and the like. Note to readers- I am horrible dyslexic, I have done my best to correct mistakes but I'm sure there will be a few. ) Hark the echoed wail of damned; lament for the souls of the mournful dead. The patroon of Cragvale, rolling shires flanked to the north and west by the nigh immeasurable pikes; broken. I finished payback yesterday, and I just want to discuss the ending with you guys. So Arkwright was the file thing that Jess and the underground soldier got, he said it’s the file to bring down the whole system, or the house I think. At the end of Wier is speaking with Kobashi, and is welcomed to Arkwright. So did Marcus want the file the whole time from the beginning of the game? I write to be mischievous, subversive and perverse. The #MeToo and "cultural appropriation" mob leaves no room for any of that (https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/other/writers-blocked-how-the-new-call-out-culture-is-killing-fiction) In the 1980s, pop psychology promoted the shibboleth that “you can’t argue with what people feel.” Since then, that line has brought many a contentious conversation to an impasse. The consequences of anointing emotion as beyond interrogation are vividly illustrate. Welcome back to another installment of your weekly listening thread, Help on the Way !! Let's keep with some more Seattle playing -- this time from 74!

Set around Muhlberg, Germany in 1911, there are alleged newspaper clippings related to the case. If any Germans from the area are available, we may find the truth behind the original case. Anyway, here we go: > Hello everyone, this is a very old story, a very crazy story, and a very long story. Please bear with me. > I heard of this story from my Great-Grandma. She heard From the New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/10/opinion/gabriel-zucman-paradise-papers-tax-evasion.html) (see the essay for the neat infographic). >The United States loses, according to my estimates, close to  billion a year in tax revenue due to the shifting of corporate profits to tax havens. That’s close to 20 percent of the corporate tax revenue that is collected each year. This is legal. >Meanwhile, an estimated .7 trillion, 11.5 percent of the entire. Hello everyone, this is a very old story, a very crazy story, and a very long story. Please bear with me. I heard of this story from my Great-Grandma. She heard this story from her own mother(GGGma) while she was growing up, as my Great-Grandma was too young at the time to understand what was happening. So, the story was somewhat personal to my family. Unfortunately, this story took place in Germany in the early, early 1900s- while, at one point we had some articles about Hello all--- I will cross post this in r/books… but I’m really hoping to make a friend too, so feel this is as good a place as any to post this. I would love to read, or listen, to a book with someone and discuss it ---(not as in the exact same moment and space--- but like, over a week or month.) It would motivate me to finish a book, maybe read something I wouldn’t otherwise, and perhaps give us both someone to talk to. I also wouldn’t mind watching a movie together some time… or a series. 
I didn't much like being in the observation area. It just felt oppressive. Like we were being watched, and not by a friendly entity. It was too much, I hated it, and Tommy was practically chewing a hole in his lip. I didn't know what else to do, so I tried to crack a few half joke half truths with Tommy, who was.less than receptive . " Well, T, looks like we figured why he's paying so much. Place is def haunted." Tommy : squinty glance and mumble yeah, right?
